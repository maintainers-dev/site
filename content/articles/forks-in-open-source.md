A "Fork" is typically when a copy of a project is taken, so it can be worked on independently of the original code base.
Think of it like a fork in the road. The original project may continue down one path whereas the "forked" version may walk down another.

There are various reasons as to why a project will be forked. 
Sometimes a project will be forked with the intention of contributing back changes, or even with the intent to be fully merged back into the original project.
Sometimes a fork will be used to created a modified version of the original project, and be kept "in sync" within the original project by continuing to take in the same changes over time.
Alternatively, a fork can be used to take a project in a completely different direction, often by a different group of people or a split of the original team.

Here are some notable examples of forks in open source:

- The office suite [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) was forked from [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/).
- The Chrome browser rendering engine, [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink/), was forked from [Webkit](https://webkit.org/), the engine it used to share with Safari.
- The database [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) was forked from [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
- The operating system [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) was forked from [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/).
- Amazon created [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) as a fork of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

Forking is a common and core part of open source, provided by the freedoms of use, modification and redistribution that open source allows.
It enables projects to adapt, evolve or become something new. 
It prevents valuable software being lost to bad authors or fixed ideas & goals.
