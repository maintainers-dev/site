When distributing your software you may desire that all, or specific, commercial entities are not allowed to use your project.
While you can define such terms within your license as you wish, this wouldn't typically be considered open source. 

Open source is intended to allow software to be freely used and distributed. Adding specific restrictions on this limits the freedoms that open source intends to provide, and can complicate matters.
While you may have good intentions in attempting to prevent perceived unfair abusive use by large companies, such commercial prevention clauses often need to be widely scoped to be effective which can cause collateral damage to smaller business, open source advocates and charities attempting to use your software in a commercial setting.

Looking to the [open source definition](https://opensource.org/osd/), the following three sections are most relevant to this topic:

- 1. Free Redistribution
- 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
- 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

Often, when looking to prevent certain types of usage, project authors are looking to give themselves a competitive advantage in the market, or protect their time invested in creating and sharing their project.
While this is a fair and reasonable desire for your own works, these kinds of intents are not what open source is for nor what open source has been built upon. Open source is *generally* about favouring openness of the code and its recipients, over that of its authors.

## Alternatives

If you would like to restrict usage of your project, but still follow many other principles of open source, you can instead provide your project as what's often called "source available", or sometimes referred to as "fair code" depending on license and intent. Here are come licensing examples in this category:

- [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/)
- [Server Side Public License (SSPL)](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)
- [Business Source License](https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-mariadb/)

Keep in mind though, while using these licenses, your project wouldn't generally be considered open source, and marketing your project as so may lead to confusion.
