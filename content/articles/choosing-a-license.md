Choosing a license is an important part of sharing your project, but there are a lot of licenses available, written in a lot of mind-numbing legal text.
To help narrow down your options, there are some high level questions you can think about.

- Should modifications be provided under the same license?
- Should those using the software be required to share the source code to end users?
- Should those distributing the software be required to provide attribution to the original authors?
- Should those distributing modified version be required to state changes they've made?
- Should use of the software, as part of a bigger project, require the wider project to be provided under the same license terms?
- Should rules on liability, trademark, warranty and patents be explicitly stated?
- Would you want to change the license in the future?

As an example let's take a brief look at two popular, but very different, licenses: [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) and the [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/) license. The MIT license is quite short & simple in 3 paragraphs of text. It basically states that "you can use, modify and distribute the software however you want, you just need to include a copyright notice in copies (attribution), but there's no warranty and the authors are not liable for issues". The AGPLv3 however is much, much longer. Like the MIT it provides the rights of use, modification and distribution, but under a lot more terms including: 

- Changes must be stated.
- Sources must be provided upon distribution (even if accessed over the web).
- Modified versions must be distributed under the same terms.
- The license terms should apply to the wider software if used as a significant part of large software works.
- Instructions to build and install the software should be provided.

And that's only scratching the surface, there's a lot of detail in the license including how requirements should be performed, and the status of other legal elements like how warranty and liability apply.

Licenses like the MIT license are often referred to as "permissive" since they allow a lot of freedom with few requirements. Some see this as a benefit, since it provides users a lot of flexibility in how they can use the software, though others may say this can enable users to take advantage by benefiting from software without contributing back. While the AGPLv3 may look complex and restrictive in comparison, it does a great job at ensuring the software itself remains open and free to other users.

But these are just two examples out of many license available. Now with a brief understanding of the range & differences, and after thinking about the questions above, you can apply your thoughts to utilise some resources like [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) or [tldrlegal.com](https://www.tldrlegal.com/browse) to help filter down and find the rights license for your project.
