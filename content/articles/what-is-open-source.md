In general open source is the idea of providing your work with the rights, guidance and original source content, so that others can use, share and build upon what has been distributed. This idea was made popular by software, thanks to the easy-to-duplicate nature of software projects, but the ideas can apply to other areas also including computer hardware, artistic content and community construction.

In this site, we're mainly talking about open source software, where the term has grow in popularity while primarily being defined by the OSI (Open Source Initiative) stewarded ["Open Source Definition"](https://opensource.org/osd/). At a very high level, this definition attempts to ensure the following forms of "open" in regards to software:

- **Open access**
  - *The original source code of the software should be provided*
- **Open use**
  - *There should be no restrictions, set by the authors, in regard to how the software is used or who it's used by*
- **Open modification**
  - *Users should be able to make modifications without significant limitations*
- **Open distribution**
  - *Software should be redistributable by others, including the ability to sell the software for money or give it away for free*

These open rights are typically provided via a license, which is often a simple text file provided by the software authors to outline the rights they grant to their users. There are many different types of licenses available, and the can vary quite significantly. Some may make requirements of you in certain scenarios, like providing attribution to the original project when redistributing, or sharing your changes under the same type of license, so it's important to understand the licence of software you use as they're not all the same.
