## Article Format

Semi-formal, blog style pages.
Small, digestable articles; Strongly prefer to split into a new article rather than nested topics.
Add structure in future where needed, keep to tags/categories for now.
Add "Further Reading" at the end of each page to internal/external resources.
Upon growth, add "Common Questions" section with questions that can be answered via other articles.
Scale tone depending on target audience level.
